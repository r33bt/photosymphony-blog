Panoramic photography captures wide-angle views, offering a unique perspective of landscapes, cityscapes, and interiors. This guide will help you create a stunning panoramic portfolio that showcases your skills and attracts potential clients.

## Essential Equipment for Panoramic Photography

To create high-quality panoramic images, you'll need the right gear:

**Wide-angle lens**: 14-24mm range for expansive views
**Tripod**: Sturdy and level for consistent shots
**Panoramic head**: Helps maintain the nodal point for seamless stitching
